	<center><h1>DVGrabGUI 0.9.4</h1></center>
	<center><h3>Usage</h3></center>

	<p>
		I coded this program because I needed a dv recording software witch I
		could control Rec/Pause command with the mouse buttons; the typical use is
		on a laptop:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Plug in the dv camera and the external mouse (put a piece of tape on
				the LED&nbsp;–&nbsp;a wireless mouse would be perfect!);
			</li>
			<li>
				Launch DVGrabGUI, adjust the settings and start the capture thread;
			</li>
			<li>
				With the touch-pad, place the mouse pointer on the video window,
				close the laptop screen (for saving batteries… Do not forget to
				uncheck the 'show video' control… saving you more cpu usage and
				batteries!). Be careful: most of the time you'll have to deactivate
				the 'sleep' function activated when closing the screen!;
			</li>
			<li>
				Go to stand-by mode (right button + left button);
			</li>
			<li>
				To record, press left button (there is a 'beep' sound as long as you
				are recording), press the right button to pause;
			</li>
			<li>
				A new video file is created each time you press left button;
			</li>
			<li>
				To leave stand-by mode, repress right button + left button;
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		This was designed to 'forget' the laptop in a backpack (for example) while
		shooting, and to keep a certain mobility. You can store your preferred
		settings in files, or make them defaults.
	</p>
	<p>
		This new version is also designed to be used with a small touchscreen
		(there is a special GUI mode for small screens&nbsp;–&nbsp;800×600).

	<h3>Notes, Bugs and workaround!</h3>
	<p>
		<h4>Notes:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				This should be the last version of this app: I plan to develop a new
				one, based on GStreamer&nbsp;–&nbsp;should be easier to maintain &
				upgrade!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4>Known bugs & workaround:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				On recent systems, you must use dvrabgui as "root" (firewire
				devices seem unusable by regular users?!?).
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are using recent version of your OS (like Fedora 7 or 8),
				this program might not work at all (like dvgrab): there are problems
				with the firewire system!
				<br>
				It seems it had been resolved in Fedora 9 (kernel 2.6.25).
				<br>
				Note that this version was developed under Debian Etch (4.0).
			</li>
			<li>
				If, while the capture thread is starting, it halt immediately, and
				there are the following messages:
				<br>
				<code>"DVG-CPT: invalid DV source specified."</code>, and
				<br>
				<code>"DVG-CPT: DV reader couldn't be initialised."</code>,
				<br>
				there is a problem with your libavc1394: you have to select the dv
				device in the 'Settings' → 'Hardware' tab ('GUID' choice box).
			</li>
			<li>
				If, while the capture thread is starting, the program shuts down
				without any warning, try to unset the 'Show video' check box
				('Settings' → 'Capture'&nbsp;–&nbsp;there is a problem with your
				libdv!).
			</li>
		</ul>
