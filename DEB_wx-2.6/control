Description: A graphical dv capture tool
 This program is based on the "dvgrab" tool (i.e. it re-uses many of its code!).
 It's major add is displaying frames of the dv stream (but cannot "display" the
 sound!)
 .
 It as been designed for "live" dv capture, i.e. direct capture from the camera
 while shooting. For this purpose, it can be used screen closed (on a laptop),
 or with a touch-screen (special GUI optimised for 800x600 resolution).
 It cannot command the "play/pause" and other VCR func.
 .
 This is the wxWidgets 2.6 version.
